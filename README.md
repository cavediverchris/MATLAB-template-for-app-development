# MATLAB Project Template For App Development
This repository contains the template files to set up a MATLAB Project for the purposes of building MATLAB Apps or Toolboxes (including blocksets). For further information on MathWorks, MATLAB and Simulink please check out the website (https://www.mathworks.com/company/aboutus.html).

# Why MATLAB Projects?
MATLABs Project are a feature within MATLAB that aims to provide a structed development environment both for solo development, but also for team working. This is achieved in collaboration with a revision control system such as Subversion or Git. At the time of writing, both Subversion (SVN) and Github are supported. In conjunction with the source control tool, MATLAB Project can be used to support both agile and robust development processes according to industry standards such as DO-178C, DO-254, DO-331 any many others.

A couple of the main reasons you want to use MATLAB Projects are:

- Easy integration with revision control systems
- Standardised development environment for all users

# How To Use This Template
